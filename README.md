# sage-weave

Sage-weave provides a framework for mixing text and Sage code for automatic
document generation, similar to Sweave and Rweave for the S and R languages,
respectively.

Sage-weave allows you to create a single source file that contains both
LaTeX text and Sage code. These are then 'woven' into a final LaTeX document
containing the original text together with the output of calculations and/or
graphics generated by Sage. This done by running the Sage code through Sage.

This is useful for re-generate reports if the input data change and documents
the code to reproduce the analysis in the same file that also contains
the report.

The Sage code of the complete analysis is embedded into a LaTeX document.

## Usage
Usage is quite simple. Just download the `weave.sage` script, and start
using it. The workflow consists of two steps. The first step is to run
Sage-weave on an input `.Snw` file (see `demos/`). This runs the Sage code
inside the given `.Snw` file and produces LaTeX output. The second step
is to compile this LaTeX output with your favorite LaTeX interpreter,
e.g., `pdflatex`.

For example:

```shell
$ weave.sage input.Snw > input.tex
$ pdflatex input.tex
```

## Demonstration
See the `demos/` directory for a demonstration.
